# Love-on-Rizz-Island-Code-Samples
Code samples written by me for Love on Rizz Island, a 2.5D survival dating sim game where you charm a silly cast of monsters by collecting gifts, smooth talking, and playing minigames, while surviving the hazardous island the game is set on.\
 \
This game was developed using the Unity game engine.\
